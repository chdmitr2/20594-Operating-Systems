The course is based on Modern Operating Systems (3rd ed.), by A.S. Tanenbaum (Prentice Hall, 2007), as well as a study guide. Note: Several printings of the 3rd edition with completely identical content are available on the market. Students will be supplied with the most recent printing available. The materials include a learning aid that describes system calls in UNIX and explanations of its use, and material that deals with installing and running the Linux system.  The course has two main objectives: Acquaintance with the design and structural principles underlying every modern operating system and practical application of these principles through advanced programming exercises in a Linux operating system. The course includes theoretical tasks and programming exercises in C on Linux that require skill in C programming.
