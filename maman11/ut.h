                user-level threads.

have to manage free slots.

/*****************************************************************************
 Initialize the library data structures. Create the threads table. If the given 
 size is otside the range [MIN_TAB_SIZE,MAX_TAB_SIZE], the table size will be 
 MAX_TAB_SIZE.
 
 Parameters:
    tab_size - the threads_table_size.

 Returns:
    0 - on success.
	SYS_ERR - on table allocation failure.

/*****************************************************************************
 Add a new thread to the threads table. Allocate the thread stack and update the
 thread context accordingly. This function DOES NOT cause the new thread to run.
 All threads start running only after ut_start() is called.

 Parameters:
    func - a function to run in the new thread. We assume that the function is
	infinite and gets a single int argument.	
	arg - the argument for func.
  
 Returns:
	non-negative TID of the new thread - on success (the TID is the thread's slot
	                                     number.
    SYS_ERR - on system failure (like failure to allocate the stack).
    TAB_FULL - if the threads table is already full.

/*****************************************************************************
 Starts running the threads, previously created by ut_spawn_thread. Sets the 
 scheduler to switch between threads every second (this is done by registering
 the scheduler function as a signal handler for SIGALRM, and causing SIGALRM to
 arrive every second). Also starts the timer used to collect the threads CPU usage
 statistics and establishes an appropriate handler for SIGVTALRM,issued by the 
 timer.
 The first thread to run is the thread with TID 0.

 Parameters:
    None.
  
 Returns:	                                   
    SYS_ERR - on system failure (like failure to establish a signal handler).
    Under normal operation, this function should start executing threads and 
	never return.
